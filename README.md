# ArtificialIntelligence
This repository contains AI algorithms and implementations in Java and C++. The types of Algorithms are divided into the subdirectories as follows:

Java -> Search Agents:
	1- Depth First Search
	2- Breadth First Search
	3- Iterative Deepening Depth First Search
	4- Maze Solver
	5- N Queen Problem Solver


C++ -> SearchAgents:



All sources have been built using the Eclipse IDE. Each implementation subfolder, therefore, also contains the .project file neccessary to open and run the project in Eclispe.
